# Introduction

EasyEDA is not just a way to draw circuit diagrams and design PCBs. It is also a circuit simulator.

A circuit simulator is basically a specialised mathematical program, optimised to construct and then solve the equations that define the behaviour of the circuit that has been described to it in the circuit diagram.

The circuit simulation program that EasyEDA uses is called ngspice. Ngspice is Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) that is in turn based on a simulator called SPICE that was originally written by Larry Nagel.

## What this book is for

This book is an introduction to circuit simulation in EasyEDA using ngspice.

It starts with the basics of how to avoid some of the most common mistakes that cause simulations to fail and then goes on to illustrate how to set up a circuit so that it will simulate successfully and produce meaningful results. It also discusses some aspects of understanding how, what might at first appear to be unexpected or even nonsensical results, can arise.

The book then introduces and illustrates more advanced techniques such as:

*   probing signals such as voltages, currents, powers and resistances;

*   configuring signal sources;

*   setting up different types of analyses;

*   making measurements such as rise times, RMS values and bandwidths;

*   defining component values using parameters;

*   using expressions to calculate component values such as for a resistor to draw a given load current or capacitances for a specified filter cutoff frequency;

*   using manufacturer's device models;

*   setting up complex simulations including arbitrary voltage and current sources.

## What this book is not for

*   This is not a book about learning to use EasyEDA to draw schematics. For general information about using EasyEDA please refer to the [EasyEDA Tutorial](http://easyeda.com/Doc/Tutorial/);

*   This book does not teach electronics. Whilst there may be examples of circuits and explanatory text that are helpful in understanding electronics, it is assumed that the user already has sufficient knowledge of electronics to understand the content of this book.* Although ngspice is similar to other variants of spice and a lot of the information and techniques in this book may be applicable to some of those variants, this book is written specifically about circuit simulation in EasyEDA using ngspice.

*   Except where necessary to help explain some aspect of the behaviour of simulation, this book does <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> go into any detail of how circuit simulation in general and ngspice in particular actually works.

## Who this book is for

All simulation tools and how they interact with schematic capture tools are different so even for people with experience of using simulation tools, it is worth at least skimming through the sections of this book to get an idea of where to find information if things don't seem to go quite as planned.

However, for people with limited or no previous experience of using simulation tools, this book is *essential* reading.

Why?

Because, as a newcomer to the world of circuit simulation, it is very tempting just to launch straight into trying to build and run lots of interesting and exciting simulations.

Sadly, however, this will almost certainly be a very frustrating and discouraging experience because many of those simulations will either not run, will not function correctly as circuits or will appear to give nonsensical results! This can happen for all sorts of very simple reasons but to newcomers with no experience of simulation, those reasons can seem utterly incomprehensible.

So, to avoid a lot of discouragement and wasted time, it is worth taking a few minutes to understand some of the most common things that can cause a simulation to fail or to run but give unexpected answers.

## How the book is structured

This book is not some dry tome with lots of words, diagrams and snippets of code. It is written as a live, interactive document. Rather than having to read lots of text and then having to go into EasyEDA to create circuits to try things out, live simulation examples are embedded directly into the text to illustrate the points being discussed.

Just go to a topic or a section heading; read a couple of paragraphs and then open and run the embedded simulation to see exactly what the text is about.

Every embedded simulation must be saved before it can be run. Users who have joined EasyEDA can save the files to their own project folder. Non-registered users can save the files to Anonymous Files. In either case, examples can be copied and edited so that users can try out different things in whatever way helps their understanding of what the example is trying to explain, building up their own personal library of teaching examples as they progress through the book.

Newcomers are encouraged to work through the book in a linear manner because each section builds on the knowledge and insights gained from all the previous ones. Skipping sections leaves gaps that can catch out the novice and hinder understanding ideas presented in later sections.

*   The book begins by introducing some of the concepts and terms that are essential for a basic understanding of what a simulator is and how to use it effectively.
*   Then, using simple interactive simulation examples it describes and illustrates how to avoid the most common pitfalls in building, running and interpreting the results from simulations.

*   The book goes on to illustrate ways to create and show connectivity using wires and netlabels in schematics. It then discusses techniques for probing voltages and currents and how they relate to and can affect or be affected by the netnames that are assigned to nets either automatically by EasyEDA or manually by the user placing netlabels.

*   More advanced techniques for probing voltages and currents using the 'probe' command are described, moving on to using this command to measure power dissipations, resistances and conductances.

This section describes the use of 0V sources to measure currents also introduces and E,F, G and H dependent sources and the very powerful arbitrary or B Dependent Sources.

In this section, the concept of the 'Spice Directive' is also introduced, describing how to turn inactive 'comment' text into active 'spice' text that the simulator then recognises as an instruction to do something.

*   The 'probe' concept is then extended by describing how several different 'probe' commands can be typed into a schematic and - simply by selecting which one is switched from being 'comment' text into 'spice' text - they can be used to swap between different selections of values and nodes to be probed.

*   The use of the 'let' command to further extend and simplify the probing of signals is introduced with a simple example. This command will feature heavily in later sections about making measurements based on the results of simulations.

*   Early interactive simulation examples introduce the basic way of setting up and running a simulation using the green running man 'Simulate...' icon (the Green Man) via the 'Run the Document...' option to open the 'Run your simulation' dialogue and then select the type of analysis to run.

*   Later examples show how to use the CTRL+R Hotkey as a shortcut to the 'Run your simulation' dialogue.

This idea is then extended with the concept of using 'spice directives' to run simulations straight from the CTRL+R Hotkey so that, with a few simple key strokes, it is easy to switch between several different simulations from a single simulation schematic.

*   DC operating point, DC Transfer function, DC Sweep, AC (frequency domain) and Transient (time domain) Analyses are described in some detail.

Using the DC Sweep to sweep the value of a resistance in a circuit and to sweep the ambient temperature for circuit is covered in this section.

There are detailed sections on setting up each of the various time

domain signal sources that are available, such as SINE, PULSE and more.

Configuring and using the frequency domain AC source that is built into to every independent signal source is covered.

*   The need for and different ways of defining initial conditions such as voltages on nets and across capacitors and currents in inductors are demonstrated.

Using PULSE, EXP, PWL and B Sources to 'kick start' circuits is also illustrated in this section.

*   The concept of using parameters (i.e. variables that are used in the simulation) to define things like multiple component values and signal source settings is described.

*   The use of parameters in expressions (i.e. formulas or equations) to calculate values such as the capacitance for a given RC time constant with a given resistance is covered and then extended into using them in B Sources.

*   The concept of predefined functions and their use in expressions is described in detail extending into the creation of user defined functions using the .func statement.

*   The concept and scope of device models in simulation is discussed in detail.

*   Ways to add 3rd party models and subcircuits into schematics and to use them with the predefined schematic symbols from the EasyEDA Libs is covered in detail.

*   The use of 3rd party models is extended into attaching them to custom schematic symbols.

*   The use of expressions and functions in the creation of custom behavioural models is covered with reference to some of the in-house EasyEDA (EE suffix) models.
